== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What is Wufoo?**

[Wufoo](http://wufoo.com) is a web app that helps anybody build amazing online forms. It's great for busy people who need to collect data or payments quickly, but don't want to deal with programming or servers. 

**Why is this useful?**

Shortcodes are clean! You can already copy and paste JavaScript or iframe code to embed a Wufoo form onto a WordPress page, but you need to make sure to be in the "HTML" tab of the writing area. If a user is in the "Visual" (default) tab, the embed code will not work. Short codes will work either way.

We also hope that this is the first step to WordPress.com integration (wink, wink).
